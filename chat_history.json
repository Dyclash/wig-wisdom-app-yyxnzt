You want me to create a plan for building a \"Wig Wisdom\" iOS quiz app using React Native and Expo 54, with a focus on wig knowledge. The app should have a feminine design with purples, pinks, and gold tones. Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen with the app title \"Wig Wisdom,\" a subtitle \"Test your wig knowledge!\", and a \"Start Quiz\" button.\n*   **Quiz System:** A multiple-choice quiz that presents one question at a time, automatically progressing upon answer selection. The quiz will cover topics like lace types, installation methods, hair types and maintenance.\n*   **Result Screen:** Displays the final score, a rank based on the score (Wig Rookie, Wig Enthusiast, Lace Master), and a \"Try Again\" button. An optional \"Learn More About Wigs\" button can be added later.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White Lavender)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#800080` (Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#DA70D6` (Orchid)\n    *   Accent: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E6E6FA` (Lavender)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new React Native project using Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement simple navigation between the Home, Quiz, and Result screens using Expo Router. This will involve modifying the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n3.  **Home Screen:** Create the Home screen with the specified title, subtitle, and \"Start Quiz\" button.\n4.  **Quiz Screen:**\n    *   Define a `Question` model with properties for question text, answer options, and the correct answer.\n    *   Create a `QuizViewModel` to manage the quiz state, including the current question, score, and user's answers.\n    *   Implement the Quiz screen to display questions and handle user input.\n5.  **Result Screen:** Create the Result screen to display the score, rank, and \"Try Again\" button.\n6.  **Styling:** Apply the specified color scheme and rounded button styles to all screens.\n7.  **Sample Questions:** Add 15-20 sample questions to the `QuizViewModel`.\n8.  **Scoring Logic:** Implement the scoring logic in the `QuizViewModel` to calculate the final score and determine the user's rank.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-24T04:27:20.677953"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the \"Wig Wisdom\" quiz app using React Native and Expo 54.

I've successfully updated all the list rendering in your app to use proper, stable keys:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. **app/quiz.tsx**\n- Changed the quiz options key from `key={index}` to `key={`${currentQuestion.id}-option-${index}-${option.substring(0, 10)}`}`\n- This creates a unique, stable key that combines:\n  - The question ID (ensures uniqueness across questions)\n  - The option index (maintains order)\n  - A portion of the option text (adds extra uniqueness)\n\n### 2. **app/(tabs)/profile.tsx**\n- Changed achievements key from `key={index}` to `key={`achievement-${achievement.id}`}`\n- Changed recent scores key from `key={index}` to `key={`recent-quiz-${index}-${quiz.date}`}`\n- These keys use the actual data properties (IDs and dates) to create stable, unique identifiers\n\n### 3. **app/(tabs)/profile.ios.tsx**\n- Applied the same key improvements as profile.tsx for consistency across platforms\n\n## Why These Changes Matter\n\n**Before:** Using just `key={index}` can cause issues when:\n- Items are reordered\n- Items are added/removed from the middle of the list\n- The list is filtered or sorted\n\n**After:** Using stable keys based on data properties ensures:\n- React can properly track each item\n- List items maintain their state correctly\n- Better performance during re-renders\n- No warnings about missing or duplicate keys\n- Items stay in the correct order even when the list changes\n\nThe keys now uniquely identify each item based on its actual data, not just its position in the array, which is the React best practice for list rendering!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-24T06:53:03Z"}]
